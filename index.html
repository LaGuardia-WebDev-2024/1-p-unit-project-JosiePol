        <h3>What do white tails help these animals with</h3>
        <par>Each animal uses their white tail with a slightly different but also similar purpose since they all developed white tails as a defense mechanism. </par>
        <h5>White Tailed Deer</h5>
        <par>The White Tailed Deer uses its tail to <em> signal danger to other members of its herd.</em> This is called "flagging". It also does this to distract predators, making the deer less obvious to predators. </par>
        <h5>Mule Deer</h5>
        <par>The Mule Deer uses its tail to <em> signal to other deers that there is danger.</em> However, unlike the White Tailed Deer, it does not help it in running away.</par>
        <h5>Rabbits</h5>
        <par>Rabbits use their tails to <em> communicate danger to other rabbits </em> and to confuse predators when running be seeming to disapear. </par>

        <h3>Where do animals with white tails live</h3>
        <par>These animals mainly live in ther <strong>North East</strong> region of America</par>
